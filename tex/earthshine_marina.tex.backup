\begin{abstract}
We obtain a low-resolution optical spectrum of the faint glow from the dark side
of the Moon, \ie the Earthshine.  We extract  the 
Earth's spectrum from it and observe absorption features of ozone, molecular oxygen, and
water. The  spectra is fitted to five
well-known models for the atmosphere and the ground of a planet with life
content, which allows us to  determine contributions of
reflectance, scattering, and transmission.  At short wavelengths, the largest
contributions come from Rayleigh scattering. At long wavelengths,
enhancements  with values of $3\pm 2\%$ starting at 740 nm were found,
corresponding to the red
reflectivity edge of vegetation.
