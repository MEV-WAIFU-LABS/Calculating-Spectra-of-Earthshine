\section{Technical Justification}


We aim the study of the Earthshine to develop a  systematic
study on the detectibility of the vegetable edge and other possible biomarkers
on
extrasolar planets.

To measure these parameters we will require (i) a spectrometer (visible
waveband) to acquire spectral information (\cite{DADOS}),
(ii) optics to focus reflected light from the moon to the spectrometer (Mt.
Stony Brook 14-inch telescope). A spectrometer will split the incoming light
of Earthshine by wavelength, having previously been focused by the optical
section of the instrument. The intensity of light at each wavelength will be
measured and recorded by the detector. It can then be plotted on to a graph of
wavelength against light intensity, which can be analyzed to find a number of
features. In order to pick up the key features of oxygen, water and vegetation
red edge, we will need to investigate the visible and near infrared sections of
the electromagnetic spectrum, with light of wavelengths between around 500 to
1000 nm.


Earthshine is brightest when most of the Earth as seen from the Moon is
illuminated, {\it i.e.}, when the Moon is only a thin crescent. However, if the
Moon is too close to the Sun, we might encounter difficulties with separating
the glow of Earthshine from the bright twilight sky (\cite{woolf_etal02}).
We select the first three nights of waxing crescent moon on April 2012. The
angular separation from the Sun to the moon in all of the days from moonrise to
sunrise is suitable for the experience , since the moon is sufficiently high
above the horizon ($>20^{\circ}$, yet sufficiently close to the Sun
($<90^{\circ}$) so that the Earthshine signal is bright.  The observations
cease on sunrise, since when the Sun reaches about 6$^{\circ}$ below the horizon
the sky will likely be too bright  to measure Earthshine. 



The Earthsine data reduction is difficult, past works \cite{seager_etal05} have
showed
that the vegetation signal is only a few percents (less than $5\%$) above the
continuum. For instance, one reason is because vegetable ares are covered by
clouds. The Earthsine has usually low S/N ration because the observations are
obtained with Moon low above the horizon, and consequently a high airmass and
low Earthsine fluxes with respect to the sky. Moreover, the detector can be
quickly saturared when recording the spectrum of the sunlit Moon crescent. 
Therefore it requires a high S/N ratio to be detected. For the low-resolution
(200 lines/mm) spectrograph grating with the narrowest (25 $\mu m$) slit, the
DADOS spectrograph manual estimates that spectra with SNR $\sim$ 20 per pixel
can be obtained by the following exposure times:
\begin{itemize}
 \item the bright limb of the Moon (5 s exposures, 10-15 median combined),
\item the sky near the dark side of the Moon (30 sec exposure),
\item thee dark side of the Moon (30 sec exposure).
\end{itemize}



To summarize, we need  around 1.5 hrs for dark exposure and around 15 min for
calibrations, suitable for the days April 15th, 16th, and 17th of 2012.
