\title{On the Masurement of the Stellar Fluxes for Interstellar Dust Extinction}

\begin{abstract}
- astronomical images in three different electromagnetic bands. 
- Build a color-color diagram, i.e., a diagram of the flux ratios among the bands, for an extincted globular cluster in the galactic plane and compare it to the known colors of stars with no dust extinction. 
- the offset between the two sets of (extincted and non-extincted) data gives the extinction vector and hence the amount of interstellar dust along the line of sight toward the globular cluster.
