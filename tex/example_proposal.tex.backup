\subsubsection*{The Possibility of Life Detection on Other Planets}
The detection of {\it exolife} has been one of the most important goals for
future space missions. Current space missions used to identify exoplanets
include \texttt{COROT}, \texttt{Spitzer} and \texttt{the Hubble Space
Telescope}, as well as the secondary extended mission of \texttt{Deep Impact
(EPOCh)} which will observe the light reflected from exoplanets
(\cite{arnold_etal07}). \texttt{ESAâ€™s Darwin} mission (estimated launch 2015)
will aim to find and study the properties and composition of Earth-like
exoplanets in the infrared. Over 300 giant exoplanets already have been
detected, and hundreds, perhaps thousands more, are anticipated in the coming
years. The nature of these planets, including their orbits, masses, sizes,
constituents, and likelihood that life could develop on them, can be probed by a
combination of observations and modeling.

Our observations will tie in with current and future missions to observe and
search for life on exoplanets. By looking at the spectra of Earth, we can
characterize what makes it suitable for sustaining life, information that can be
related to present and future exoplanet observations. This search is
characterized by the detection of possible {\it biomarkers} on Earth-like
exoplanets. On a first approach, they are simple molecules present in the
planet's atmosphere, such as $O_2, O_3, CO_2,$ and $H_2O$ (see Fig.\ref{2}-a).
Further studies aims for the detectibility of a proper signature of life from
the planet's surface, considering, for instance, green vegetation as a biormaker
\citep{seager_etal05}.


Spectrum of solar flux that reaches the ground after absorption through Earth's
atmosphere. Vegetation reflects or transmits almost all incident radiation at
wavelengths where sunlight has about 40$\%$ of its energy. The {\it vegetation
reflectance} (vegetation spectral signature) has a specific
spectrum, with a sharp edge of $\lambda =  700$ nm in the visible
electromagnetic spectra due to the missing photons used in photosynthetic
process. This
is detected as a {\it positive shift} above the continuous spectra, starting at
this wavelength and is also know as the {\it Vegetation Red Edge} (VRE) (see
Fig. \ref{1}-b).

\subsubsection*{The Earthshine as a Tool to the Study of other Earth-like
Systems}

The observation of the spectrum of {\it Moon Earthshine}, \ie the reflection of
the Earth's light on the non-sunlit Moon, allows one to observe the
Earth as any distant planet, and to perform studies on the detectibility of
biomarkers ({\it e.g.} VRE) in its spectrum. Extracting the Earth albedo from
the Earthshine spectrum requires the measurement of moonlight spectra (lit side
of the moon) and the Earthshine spectra (unlit portion of the moon) in the
visible wavelength \citep{woolf_etal02} (see Fig. \ref{2}).

The spectrum of the light reflected by the planet, when normalized to the Sun
(parent star spectrum) gives the planet reflectance spectrum revealing its
atmospheric and ground color (if this is visible by a transparent atmosphere).

\section{Technical Justification}


We aim the study of the Earthshine to develop a  systematic
study on the detectibility of the vegetable edge and other possible biomarkers
on
extrasolar planets.

To measure these parameters we will require (i) a spectrometer (visible
waveband) to acquire spectral information (\cite{DADOS}),
(ii) optics to focus reflected light from the moon to the spectrometer (Mt.
Stony Brook 14-inch telescope). A spectrometer will split the incoming light
of Earthshine by wavelength, having previously been focused by the optical
section of the instrument. The intensity of light at each wavelength will be
measured and recorded by the detector. It can then be plotted on to a graph of
wavelength against light intensity, which can be analyzed to find a number of
features. In order to pick up the key features of oxygen, water and vegetation
red edge, we will need to investigate the visible and near infrared sections of
the electromagnetic spectrum, with light of wavelengths between around 500 to
1000 nm.


Earthshine is brightest when most of the Earth as seen from the Moon is
illuminated, {\it i.e.}, when the Moon is only a thin crescent. However, if the
Moon is too close to the Sun, we might encounter difficulties with separating
the glow of Earthshine from the bright twilight sky (\cite{woolf_etal02}).
We select the first three nights of waxing crescent moon on April 2012. The
angular separation from the Sun to the moon in all of the days from moonrise to
sunrise is suitable for the experience , since the moon is sufficiently high
above the horizon ($>20^{\circ}$, yet sufficiently close to the Sun
($<90^{\circ}$) so that the Earthshine signal is bright.  The observations
cease on sunrise, since when the Sun reaches about 6$^{\circ}$ below the horizon
the sky will likely be too bright  to measure Earthshine. 



The Earthsine data reduction is difficult, past works \cite{seager_etal05} have
showed
that the vegetation signal is only a few percents (less than $5\%$) above the
continuum. For instance, one reason is because vegetable ares are covered by
clouds. The Earthsine has usually low S/N ration because the observations are
obtained with Moon low above the horizon, and consequently a high airmass and
low Earthsine fluxes with respect to the sky. Moreover, the detector can be
quickly saturared when recording the spectrum of the sunlit Moon crescent. 
Therefore it requires a high S/N ratio to be detected. For the low-resolution
(200 lines/mm) spectrograph grating with the narrowest (25 $\mu m$) slit, the
DADOS spectrograph manual estimates that spectra with SNR $\sim$ 20 per pixel
can be obtained by the following exposure times:
\begin{itemize}
 \item the bright limb of the Moon (5 s exposures, 10-15 median combined),
\item the sky near the dark side of the Moon (30 sec exposure),
\item thee dark side of the Moon (30 sec exposure).
\end{itemize}



To summarize, we need  around 1.5 hrs for dark exposure and around 15 min for
calibrations, suitable for the days April 15th, 16th, and 17th of 2012.
